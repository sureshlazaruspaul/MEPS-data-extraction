# meps_extract_stata
## Extract Medical Expenditure Panel Survey's Household Consolidated Data Files using Stata

- This code downloads the datasets between the years 1996 and 2017 to the "C:\MEPS\DATA" directory by remotely running the Stata scripts that are published in the MEPS website. 

- There is no need to manually download Stata codes for each year and execute locally.

- Should you require codes for individual years, they are available at the following link: https://meps.ahrq.gov/data_stats/download_data/pufs/XYZ/XYZstu.txt, where `XYZ` are yearly dataset names. For example, for 2012, it is `h155` 

- Log files are produced for each year of data extraction in the same destination directory - "C:\MEPS\DATA".
